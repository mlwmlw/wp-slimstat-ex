Fresh View v1.03 by Kyle Rove

================================================================================
 Introduction to Fresh View for Mint (1.2+)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fresh View uses XML-based SVG (scalable vector graphics) to visualize your
Mint visitor data. Although SVG as a standard has been around since 1999,
browser makers are just getting around to implementing this standard natively.
Currently, Opera is the only browser with shipping SVG. Mozilla has an SVG-
capable version of Firefox in beta (Firefox 1.5 Beta 2) due for release soon.
Safari for Mac OS X is the midst of gaining SVG support, but it is not clear how
soon production release of an SVG-capable version will occur. Alternatively,
users can download the Adobe SVG plugin:

Windows:
http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/beta.html
http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/windows-all.html#AdobeSVG (how to install Adobe SVG
plugin with Firefox 1.0.x)

Mac OS X, *nix:
http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/

*** Note that Adobe SVG Plugin likes to cache files very persistently on the
local hard drive. Sometimes to get graphs to update, you may need to either:
  1. Refresh the entire page
  2. Emtpy your browser cache, or
  3. Restart your browser.

Additionally, most web hosts do not currently have rules setup to correctly
serve .svg files as XML. Users with Apache setups do not have to worry about
this, as a .htaccess file with the correct rules exists in the
/kylerove/freshview/caches/ directory. As I do not have access to other web
servers (i.e. IIS), I cannot support Fresh View under these circumstances.
Please use the Mint forum at http://www.haveamint.com/forum/ as a resource if
you do not have Apache.

Recommended Browser Setups to View Fresh View for Mint:
Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 (Windows, Mac OS X, *NIX)
Firefox 1.0.6 with Adobe SVG Plugin v6 (Windows)
Safari 1.3 or 2.0 with Adobe SVG Plugin v3 (Mac OS X)

Current Known Issues
- Due to the changing Pepper API, Fresh View is only compatible with Mint 1.2+!
- Adobe SVG Plugin persistently caches SVG files on the local hard drive
- Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 does not support the guassian blur filter and puts an error
  in the JavaScript console; This error does not affect the ability to use Fresh
  View

================================================================================
 Installing Fresh View
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have never installed Fresh View, follow these instructions:

1. Upload the /kylerove/ directory and its contents to /mint/pepper/.

2. Permissions: chmod 775 (or 777, in some web setups) the following items:

        /mint/pepper/kylerove/freshview/caches
        /mint/pepper/kylerove/freshview/caches/pastday_graph.svg
        /mint/pepper/kylerove/freshview/caches/pastmonth_graph.svg
        /mint/pepper/kylerove/freshview/caches/pastweek_graph.svg
        /mint/pepper/kylerove/freshview/caches/pastyear_graph.svg

3. Login to your Mint installation, and in the Preferences click "Install" under
   Pepper.

If you are updating Fresh View, follow these instructions:

1. Login to your Mint installation, and in the Preferences click on Fresh View
   to see its preferences. Click "Uninstall."
   
2. Empty your browser caches to ensure that no old CSS or JS files remain of
   the old version. If you are unsure how to do this, consult your browser's
   Help system.

3. Upload the directory /kylerove/ to your /mint/pepper/ directory, replacing
   the existing files.
